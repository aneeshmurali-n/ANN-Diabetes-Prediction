# Diabetes Progression Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks
Predicting diabetes progression using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This project leverages the scikit-learn diabetes dataset for training and evaluation. Includes data preprocessing, model building, and performance visualization.


## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting diabetes progression using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It leverages the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn for training and evaluation. The project demonstrates the application of ANNs in healthcare for diabetes prediction.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn, which contains data on diabetes progression in patients.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing the features.
2. **Model Building:** An ANN model is designed and built using Keras.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) are used to assess the model's performance.
4. **Visualization:** The results are visualized using plots and charts to provide insights into the model's predictions and performance.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `DL_ANN_Diabetes_Progression_Prediction.ipynb`
4. **Or, run the notebook in Google Colab:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aneeshmurali-n/ANN-Diabetes-Prediction/blob/main/DL_ANN_Diabetes_Progression_Prediction.ipynb)


## Results

The ANN model achieved promising results in predicting diabetes progression, with a low MAE, MSE, and a high R2 score. 
Further improvements can be explored by tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different architectures, and incorporating more data.
